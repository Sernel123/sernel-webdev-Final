            of Benagil (Gruta de Benagil), where the Algar de Benagil is also located. This gigantic cave is sometimes
            referred to as the Benagil Cathedral because of the various arches it forms, which, viewed from the outside
            of the cave, give it the appearance of a cathedral. The imposing aspect of the Cathedral, with its various
            shades of yellow, remind us of the devastating power of nature. For years, wind and water dug one of the
            planet’s most fantastic caves, which attracts thousands of tourists to windward Algarve every year.</p>
